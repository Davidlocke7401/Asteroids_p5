# Asteroids_p5
My first p5.js project; recreating Asteroids (or attempting to...).


This is my first attempt at creating a very simple game using the p5.js library. 
In this demo, I utilized perlin noise generation to create randomly shapped asteroids.
I would like to thank the Coding Train as acting as my inspiration for using p5 and perlin noise!

The controls are quite simple, wasd to move, j and l to rotate the agent, and k to fire.
